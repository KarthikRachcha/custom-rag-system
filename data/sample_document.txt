LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends the LangChain expression language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner.

The key concepts in LangGraph include:
1. State Management: LangGraph maintains state across multiple steps of computation
2. Nodes: Functions that can read and write to the state
3. Edges: Define the flow between nodes
4. Cycles: Allow for iterative processes

LangGraph is particularly useful for building:
- Chatbots with memory
- Multi-step reasoning systems
- Workflow automation
- Agent-based applications

The library provides a simple way to define complex workflows while maintaining clean separation of concerns between different components of your system.
